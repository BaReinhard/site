# Food Oasis

This is a website with a map of food sources in Los Angeles, and list of resources about food deserts and health. You can view the site here…
https://foodoasis.la

## How to make changes

The website is published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and the files are generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

As you make changes and commit/push them to GitHub, the website will automatically update.

## How to develop locally

If you want to see a preview of your changes before they appear on the live site, you can [run a Jekyll server](https://jekyllrb.com) on your local machine. [Installing Ruby and Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) is a good place to start.

## How to update the food source data

The food sources listed on the website are generated by Jekyll, from markdown files in these folders…
```
_community-gardens/*
_farmers-markets/*
_food-pantries/*
```

The markdown files themselves are generated by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) from the data files in the `_data` folder.

To re-generate the files, first install Node.js. And then run this command from your project folder…

```
node _node/generate-locations.js
```

Note that this will overwrite the existing markdown files, but it won’t remove any of them. You may wish to manually remove these three folders first, before running `generate-locations.js` to remove any unneeded markdown files.
```
_community-gardens/*
_farmers-markets/*
_food-pantries/*
```
