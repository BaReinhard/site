[Seeds of Hope](http://seedsofhope.ladiocese.org/) is a ministry of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles which works with congregations, communities, and schools, to turn unused land into productive and beautiful gardens and orchards that provide fresh and nutritious foods to areas of need across the county. Join us for our garden work days at St. Paul’s to help us grow this ministry of sustainable food justice! To catch an upcoming work day, stay tuned to our [calendar of events](http://www.saintpaulspomona.org/events)
