Food Oasis Los Angeles caught attention of CNN Tech, which presents a top stories section with news about the internet, games, business tech and personal tech. On the interview, the team explained how civic tech plays an important role as a new form of volunteerism and how is the workflow of the Hack Night weekly meetings. The team demonstrated how FOLA is not only a platform to help solve one of the biggest urban challenges, but a tool towards a more equitable, inclusive, bottom-up way of changing cities.
