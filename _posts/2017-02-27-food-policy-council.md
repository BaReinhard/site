Food Oasis Los Angeles (FOLA) presented foodoasis.la at the Los Angeles Food Policy Council’s [Farmers Market Working Group](http://goodfoodla.org/policymaking/working-groups-2/farmers-markets-for-all/ ) to demonstrate the platform to a key constituent group: Farmers Markets.

This presentation reinforced the vision of the FOLA platform as an “income neutral” resource. We look forward to our continued work with the Food Policy Council and Farmer’s Markets!
