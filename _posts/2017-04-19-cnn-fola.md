The CNN article is out! Back in December 2016,[Food Oasis Los Angeles (FOLA)](https://foodoasis.la/) was interviewed by CNN Tech about their work as part of a growing movement where hackers get together to make a civic and social impact.

In the article, representative, appointee, and community advocate Andrew Douglas writes about the potential for the tech sector to confront persistent social deficits head-on. FOLA is highlighted as a shining example of such tech/civic collaboration.
